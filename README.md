# Mouse-A-Sketch

### Deliverable

Build a sketch program!

A visitor to your site should be able to "draw" with their mouse, simply by moving their cursor around the screen. They should also be able to "pick" a color, using the HTML5 colorpicker.

### Tips


* Take a good look at `index.html` and `styles.css` in the starter code and make sure you understand what both are doing.

* This project can be completed in only 5 lines of code!

* You can find a basic solution to this exercise in the solution directory.  Challenge yourself to avoid look at the solutions for at least the first 45 minutes of working on this project.

* As an extra challenge, you can try removing the table from the HTML and using JavaScript to draw divs on the page instead. A working example of this approach is in the div-solution directory.
