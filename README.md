# Mouse-A-Sketch

Take a good look at `index.html` and `styles.css` in the starter code and make sure you understand what both are doing.

**Goal:**

Can you build an etch-a-sketch?

A visitor to your site should be able to "draw" with their mouse, simply by moving their cursor around the screen. They should also be able to "pick" a color, using the HTML5 colorpicker.

Challenge yourself to avoid look at the solutions for at least the first 45 minutes of working on this project.

**Solution**

You can find a basic solution to this exercise in the solution directory.

As an extra challenge, you can try removing the table from the HTML and using JavaScript to draw divs on the page instead. A working example of this approach is in the div-solution directory.
